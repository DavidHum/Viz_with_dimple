# Summary

Here we have a bar chart of the handedness (righty, lefty, or both) of 1,157 baseball players. In this chart we are comparing the average of all the home runs that those player have hit and we are grouping them by their handedness. We are showing the comparison between handedness. Here we can see that lefty baseball player have more home runs on average than righty of ambidextrous players


# Design

In the first sketch I originally plotted, it was a scatter plot of batting average and home runs coloured by handedness. After the feedback I received, I changed it to a bar plot of average home runs hit by handedness. This plot conveys the difference between handedness of baseball player.

# Feedback

With the first sketch, that was the scatter plot, the feedback that people gave me is that there was relation between batting average and home runs, but it was not so clear and that the plot was too clutered up. There was no clear distinction betwwen points and that obscured that relation. After that I made a bar plot of handedness and home runs, the feeedback they gave was that is showed sum of home runs and it's not something that is informative at all and even suggested to use average of home runs by handedness. And so, the last one was instead of sum of home runs it was average of home runs by handednes.
